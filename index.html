    <p>i'm currently a junior at the university of illinois (uiuc) studying computer science. my interests include robotics, deep learning, math, and software engineering.</p>
    <p>last summer, i was doing full-stack development for capital one. the summer before that, i was finetuning large language models for a startup.</p>
    <p>at uiuc, i'm currently a founder and co-chair for SIGRobotics, a special interest group under ACM@UIUC dedicated to encouraging project-based exploration in robotics. i was also previously part of the Gies Disruption Lab, where I led a team of 6 students to develop an AI tutor by finetuning large language models on coursework.</p>
